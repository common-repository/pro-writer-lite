== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does your support video and other embeds? =

Yes!

= What do I get with the free version? =

Our lite plugin allows you to make headlines, add images, links 
and media. Our commercial plugin allows you to create layouts, add
buttons, contact forms, social share icons and more. Please visit our 
website at: http://prowriter.co to learn more

= Does your plugin work with shortcodes? =

Our free plugin ghosts shortcodes, coloring them gray and preventing you
from overwriting them. You will still be able to edit the rest of 
the copy of your pages as well as text in between.

This will only affect  pages and posts where you have added functionality 
via another third-party add-ons, or are using a plugin to create layouts.

= What is available with the commercial version of your product? =

With the commercial version of Pro Writer, you will be able to add text columns, 
buttons, newsletters, social share icons and more. There is also a more complete 
set of writing tools.

The commercial version of our plugin will work with all shortcodes, allowing
you to edit pages and posts with all their extended functionality visible in
edit mode and is compatible with Visual Composer.

We are always adding functionality to our plugin and as a Pro Writer customer, 
you will receive upgrade for free.
